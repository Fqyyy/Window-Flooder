# Window-Flooder
This script creates a "playful" attack on the system by opening an infinite number of message windows in random places on the screen. Windows appear with a preset delay and a limited number of simultaneously active threads to reduce the load on the system. The script also includes the ability to restore the system after a shutdown.
